  = note: `CheckFillsUnalignedBits` is a "sealed trait", because to implement it you also need to implement `scryer_modular_bitfield::private::checks::FillsUnalignedBits`, which is not accessible; this is usually done to force you to use one of the provided types that already implement it
  = help: the following type implements the trait:
            scryer_modular_bitfield::private::checks::True
